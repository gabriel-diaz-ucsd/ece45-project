# ECE45-project

 Audio synthesizer project created by ECE 45 students, written using the MATLAB language and MATLAB GUI
 
 Will add member names shortly
 
 ## Function Prototypes
 
 function x = generate_wave(amplitude, frequency, phase, fs, duration, duty)
 
fuction x = envelope(input, fs, period, attack , decay, sustain, release)
where attack, decay, sustain release are percentages between 0 to 1 of the period
where period is the time in seconds

function  output_timedomain = Filter(input_soundin_timedomain, Fs, LOW, MED, HIGH) 
where LOW, MED, HIGH are user-selected variables of any value. **try to make an envelope for the filter as well**
