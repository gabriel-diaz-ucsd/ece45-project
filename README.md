fuction x = envelope(input, fs, period, attack , decay, sustain, release)
where attack, decay, sustain release are percentages between 0 to 1 of the period
where period is the time in seconds

function x = generate_wave(amplitude, frequency, phase, fs, duration, duty)


function  output_timedomain = Filter(input_soundin_timedomain, Fs, LOW, MED, HIGH) 
where LOW, MED, HIGH are user-selected variables of any value
